$software[1][2]="For the DURACON Program, the modelling of chloride penetration and time to depassivation are based on Fick's Second Law of Diffusion in combination with a time dependent diffusion coefficient. The software also incorporates the stochastic nature of the individual durability parameters which are needed as input. These durability parameters include the diffusion coefficient, which may either be obtained from accelerated laboratory testing or curve fitting of chloride profiles from existing concrete structures, the time dependence of the diffusion coefficient and the critical chloride content for depassivation of embedded steel, both of which may be obtained from existing literature or other experience for the given type of cement and concrete.";
