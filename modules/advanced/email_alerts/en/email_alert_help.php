            The 
              alerts service is delivering the information you need - and 
            only that.&nbsp; You decide what you receive. Simple newsletters are 
            a thing of the past.<BR>

      <P><B>No newsletter...</B><BR><BR>Every portal is offering some kind of a 
      newsletter which you may receive weekly, mothly or even daily. Sometimes, 
      these newsletters may not provide you the informations that are really 
      important. <BR><BR>
      We have decided to provide Alerts instead of 
      simple newsletters. Just because we all receive enough mails, don't 
      we?<BR>
      <BR><BR><B>Alerts are different...</B><BR>
      <BR>
      You may save 
      searches for specific information as an  Alert and as soon as new 
      information is available, we will notify you automatically by email. If 
      you are looking for something - let our system do the work for 
      you.<BR>
      <BR><BR><B>Customizable...</B><BR><BR>You decide what kind of 
      information you like to receive. <BR><BR><BR><B>Switch it off anytime 
      ...</B><BR><BR>
      You're in holidays and your connection is slower? No longer 
      interested to receive a certain  Alert? Other information is more 
      important to you? Just switch it off anytime or delete it - one click is 
      enough...<BR>
